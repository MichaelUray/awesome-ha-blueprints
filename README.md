A curated collection of blueprints for Home Assistant.

Reliable, customizable, fully tested by the community.

**Note:** This is a repository fork to include community fixes to the original code, all credits to the original developer. As the original documentation is still online, many links return there. The only thing that changes is the repository (EPMatt ➡️lsismeiro) and the fixes under the hood.
